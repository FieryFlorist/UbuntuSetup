# UbuntuSetup
Reminders and defaults for my preferred Ubuntu setup

# Install Ubuntu
Recommended to create a swap partition that is as large as my RAM. It is also recommended to separate the system and home partitions so you can more easily reinstall the system, though I have yet to have an issue with this.

# Install Conda
In the long term it is difficult to keep my python environments consistent. Install conda to manage my environments.

Miniconda is nice on Ubuntu to keep the library a little more light-weight. Though I then need to install numpy, scipy, pandas, numba, and imageio.

# Install Dropbox
This is a useful way to share my files between computers.

# Install Z-Shell
I like having z-shell.

# Install Neovim
Honestly, the main thing I like is the improved OS integration (especially for clipboard interaction).
